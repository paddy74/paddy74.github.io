My name is Patrick Young. I am an exceptional self-driven software engineer with 6+ years of technical experience in the industry with a specialization in technical leadership and system design for internal data analytics platforms and data engineering teams. My track record demonstrates multiple data analytics modernization efforts in mixed-security environments for public and highly sensitive government deployments.
