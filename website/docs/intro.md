# My Handbook

Welcome to my personal technical reference documentation handbook compiled throughout my career as a software engineer. This handbook provide a single source of truth for my _opinionated_ approaches to project management, product development, engineering standards, coding conventions, and more!

That includes this handbook itself, which is my preferred approach to internal documentation - meaning that you will see language suited to as if this was maintained by an organization and not an individual.

:::note

A **handbook** is not for API documentation or user guides. A **handbook**, stated simply, is an internal collection of collaboratively-maintained content that an organization's members need to do their job.
