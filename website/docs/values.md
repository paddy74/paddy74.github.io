# Values

This page reflects my values as a professional in my field.

## Transparency

Be open about as many things as possible. Making information accessible (i.e., public) lowers the threshold to contribution and makes collaboration easier. Use accessible work tracker and project repositories when possible. Transparency is not communication; just because something exists in the handbook or elsewhere does not mean it can't be communicated again or in a more robust fashion to the people who need to understand or acknowledge it. On a personal level, be direct when sharing information and admin when you have made a mistake or wrong. When something does go wrong it is an opportunity for improvement; say "What's the [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) moment here?" and find a better way without hurt feelings or injured pride.

## Everything is in Draft

Rarely mark any content or proposals as drafts because everything is considered to always be in-draft and subject to change. With this approach, contributions from internal members and all readers are welcomed. By having everything in draft and [assuming others have low context](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/#understanding-low-context-communication), people have shared access to the same information and the risk of confusing, duplicate, redundant, or out-of-date information is reduced.
