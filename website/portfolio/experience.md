# Work Experience

## Technical Lead

- Grade: GS-14
- National Aeronautics and Space Administration
- Aug 2023 - July 2025 | Hampton, VA

As the Technical Lead of NASA Data & Analytics Services, I led the architecture, implementation, and adoption of NASA's enterprise data platforms to drive Agency-wide data modernization, data governance, scalable data analytics, and AI development in businessand mission-critical environments.

- Designed and led implementation of NASA's Enterprise Data Platform built with AWS, Databricks, Airflow, Kubernetes, and Entra ID (Active Directory) to enable the enterprise data mesh, zero-trust data-based access control, scalable data product development, and consolidation of data silos across mission directorates and business groups.
- Managed parallel Agile teams of up to 30 platform engineers, data analysts, analysts, and data scientists; implemented DevSecOps practices including test-driven development, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), peer code reviews, continuous delivery, incident management, and compliance automation.
- Worked with the Agency's Chief Data Officer to champion the NASA Data & Analytics Center of Excellence, promoting modern DevSecOps principles, data literacy, and a sustainable, collaborative data culture across the Agency.
- Served as the Data & Analytics representative on NASA's IT Technical Review Board, ensuring enterprise software initiatives aligned with the NASA Data Strategy, long-term architectural goals, and regulatory requirements.
- Provided professional consulting services to mission and operational teams building data products on the Enterprise Data Platform, improving internal knowledge sharing, data reliability and trust, pipeline performance, cost efficiency, documentation quality, and on-boarding time.

## Software Engineer

- Grade: Associate
- Booz Allen Hamilton
- Sept 2020 - Aug 2023 | Newport News, VA

As a lead software engineer and deputy project manager supporting Army T2COM G2, I developed full-stack data management, discovery, analytics, and visualization systems and threat-actor network analysis tools, accelerating the creation of training and doctrine research publications.

- Designed and built T2COM G2's Training & Doctrine Research Data Platform in Azure GovCloud (IL4) using a microservice-based architecture; implemented ETL/data pipelines, data versioning, natural-language search, and full-stack web-applications; built with C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, ReactJS, Python, FastAPI, and Azure SQL Server.
- Developed OEVis, a full-stack graph-network analytics and simulation tool with real-time co-authoring, cloud-sync, and custom "bring-your-own-model" analytics model execution; replacing outdated commercial tools and cutting licensing costs.
- Managed a team of 14 developers using Agile delivery processes including sprint planning, backlog refinement, release planning, and reporting to ensure on-time, stable releases, rapid incident response, and sustained team performance.
- Conducted hands-on requirements investigation with analysts and client leadership, translating operational needs into clear engineering tasks, technical designs, program increments, and release milestones.
- Maintained the project's knowledge base in Confluence, authoring technical documentation, API specifications, requirements definitions, on-boarding materials, and end-user guides - establishing knowledge continuity throughout the project lifetime.

## Full-Stack Developer

- Grade: Junior
- Intelligent Decision Systems, Inc.
- Jan 2019 - Sept 2020 | Newport News, VA

As a Full-Stack Developer and Machine Learning Engineer at IDSI, I built zero-trust ReactJS/Python/Java/C++ data-discovery microservices, developed NLP-based semantic search and time-aware recommendation models (improving ranking by 10%), and deployed analytics services in Azure to accelerate T2COM G2 research and publication workflows.

## Research Assistant

- Grade: Undergraduate
- ODU Research Foundation, Computer Vision Lab
- April 2017 - Dec 2018 | Norfolk, VA

As a Research Assistant with the ODU Computer Vision Lab, I developed Python- and C++-based deep learned computer-vision models for identifying abnormal (cancerous) brain tissue in MRI scans, trained models for gait-recognition in LiDAR video, and introduced the lab's Git/GitHub version-control practices.
